First, because of the operators' order of precedence, the expression *ptr + 1 = 20 means (*ptr) + 1 = 20. The expression (*ptr) + 1 evaluates to the int 31, not an int variable that can be assigned to. When corrected to *(ptr+1) = 20, the expression means *(&arr[1]) = 20, which means arr[1] = 20.

Second, the while loop doesn't access arr[2], and tries to access arr[-1]. One possible fix is

	for (ptr = arr; ptr < arr + 3; ptr++)
		cout << *ptr << endl;
findMax puts the correct value in pToMax, but pToMax is a copy of the caller's variable ptr, so findMax has no effect on ptr. The parameter pToMax must be passed by reference, not by value:

	void findMax(int arr[], int n, int*& pToMax)
The declaration int* ptr; declares ptr to be a pointer to int, but leaves it uninitialized â€” it does not point to any particular int. That uninitialized pointer is copied into the parameter ncubed. In the expression *ncubed = n*n*n, the attempt to dereference the uninitialized ncubed pointer leads to undefined behavior. A fix would be to make sure computeCube is passed a valid pointer; one possibility is, in the main routine, to say:

	int k;
	int* ptr = &k;
The test str1 != 0 is asking if the str1 pointer itself has a value different from the null pointer. (The integer constant 0 used in a context where a pointer is required means the null pointer.) The test we want, though, is to see if the character pointed to by str1 is different from the zero byte that marks the end of a C string. (The same applies to str2.)

Similarly, the test str1 != str2 is asking whether those two pointers have different values (i.e., they point to different places). But what should be tested is whether the characters they point to have different values. (The same applies to str1 == str2.)

The corrected function body is thus

	while (*str1 != '\0'  &&  *str2 != '\0')  // 0 instead of '\0' is also OK
	{
	    if (*str1 != *str2)
		return false;
	    str1++;
	    str2++;
	}
	return *str1 == *str2;
The storage for the local variable anArray goes away when the function getPtrToArray returns. But that function returns a pointer to that storage. Attempting to follow that pointer in the main routine (implied by ptr[i]) yields undefined behavior.

double* cat;
double mouse[5];
cat = &mouse[4];   or   cat = mouse + 4;
*cat = 25;
*(mouse + 3) = 54;
cat -= 3;
cat[1] = 42;
cat[0] = 27;
bool b = *cat == *(cat+1);
bool d = cat == mouse;   or   bool d = cat == &mouse[0];

double mean(const double* scores, int numScores)
{
    int k = 0;
    double tot = 0;
    while (k != numScores)
    {
        tot += *(scores + k);
        k++;
    }
    return tot/numScores;
}

        if (*(str+k) == chr)
            return str + k;

    return nullptr;
}
const char* findTheChar(const char* str, char chr)
{
    for ( ; *str != 0; str++)
        if (*str == chr)
            return str;

    return nullptr;

maxwell is called with pointers to array[0] and array[2]. It returns a pointer to whichever of the ints pointed to has a larger value. Since array[0] has the larger value, the function returns &array[0]. The expression *ptr = -1 sets array[0] to -1.
ptr[i] = 9; sets array[3] to 9.
*(array+1) = 79; sets array[1] to 79.
&array[5] - &array[2] is 3.
The swap1 function swaps its copies of the pointers passed in to it, with no effect on the ints pointed to.
The swap2 function swaps the ints pointed to.
